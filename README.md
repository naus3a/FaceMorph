FACE MORPH
==================

An OpenFrameworks application that morphs a face into another face, into a given amount of time.
In order to get a photorealistic effect, the source and destination faces are automatically overlapped using [Jason Saragih's face tracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/FaceTracker) and the morphing itself is computed using Arturo Castro's and Kyle McDonald's [face cloning"technique](https://github.com/arturoc/FaceSubstitution).

This application is free software and was originally developed to assist Parma University's Neuroscience department in the conduction of experiments in the field of self-perception.
